Bookmark Save Addin for VB6
By Darin Higgins


Includes various code elements from around the web, all annotations left intact.


Written in VB.net, using the .net 4.0 framework.

Notable features:

 * Can be registered with plain 'ol REGSVR32, just like any other COM addin

 * Always save bookmarks and breakpoints

 * automatically saves bookmarks and breakpoints when they're changed.

 * Adds hotkeys for
      1) Toggling bookmarks (Ctrl-k)
      2) Next Bookmark (Alt-Right)
      3) Prev Bookmark (Alt-Left)

 * Attempts to detect and preserve breakpoints, no matter how they're set:
      1) via menus
      2) via right click menus
      3) via f9 hotkey
      4) via click in code edit window margin

 * Makes use of my GenerateLineMap utility for embedding line number information 
   directly into the DLL

 * Makes use of ExportDLL utility to Automatically export standard DLL registration
   entry points


Caveats:

 * Since VB doesn't actually expose any functionality for tracking bookmarks or breakpoints
   keeping things synchronized between what VB knows to exist and what the addin tracks is
   tricky at best. For the most part, the addin tracks things very well, but it IS possible
   for the addin to loose track of a bookmark or breakpoint. When this happens, the only real
   effect is that if you close the project and then reopen it, you might get a bookmark or 
   breakpoint either not restored, or restored to a slightly different location.

 * Also note that since the tracking process relies on the use of the VB IDE, if you edit
   source code in any other editor after bookmarks or breakpoints have been set, when you load
   the code back into the VB IDE, the bookmarks or breakpoints may be restored to the wrong 
   locations.
