This is a quick project that was needed for some data processing

it allows you pass a search results list from the main addin to this
for further parsing/data extraction.

data manipulation is done through javascript (msscript.ocx)

this project has a reference to the open source dzrt.dll

https://github.com/dzzie/libs/tree/master/dzrt

I will probably rip the relevant code and include it compile in
to this project at sometime to remove the external dependancy.
