'Title          Ulli's VB Companion
'
'               Adds Mouse Wheel Support and Auto Complete plus a few other Goodies to
'               the VB IDE.
'
'               Simply compile the .DLL into your VB folder and restart VB.
'
'Notes          Using this Add-In together with other Add-Ins which also subclass the IDE
'               may crash VB because VB apparently fires the OnBeginShutdown events not
'               in reverse order of OnStartupComplete. Therefore unhooking the IDE will
'               not work correctly and will eventually leave VB with a dead hook to a
'               non-existent window procedure.
'======
'How To     >>  Hold down secondary (right) mouse button and rotate wheel to open
'======         Options Dialog Box.
'
'           >>  Hold down Shift or Cntl or both while scrolling to decrease scroll
'               distance temporarily.
'
'           >>  Press Pause key to open member list.
'               The member names shown are those only which are within scope of the current
'               code module.
'               Click on any member name to insert it into your code.
'               Click on column header to sort by that column.
'               Click on Exit or press Escape to abandon.
'
'   NEW     >>  Press Shift+Pause keys to open multiline literal box. The literal box
'               will help you to design long multiline text literals and convert them to
'               the proper VB syntax, including newlines, quotes and line continuation
'               marks.
'               Enter the text as you would like to see it during program execution.
'               Press Pause key or click on Preview to see an actual example of the
'               VB-interpretation of the converted "syntaxed" text in a message box.
'               Press Shift+Return to insert the converted text into your code.
'               Press Escape to abandon.
'               You can also copy a literal from the codepane and paste that into
'               the box, the VB syntax will be un-converted during the paste process.
'
'   NEW     >>  Click on Reset (main menu bar) when it's green to reset all changes
'               (code AND visual elements) which were made since you last saved the
'               current component.
'
'   NEW     >>  Click on Compare (main menu bar) to see all alterations of the current
'               component (code AND visual elements) which were made since you last
'               saved the it.
'
'   NEW     >>  Click on OpenAll (main menu bar) to open all available codepanes.
'
'   NEW     >>  Click on Copy (main menu bar) to open the Copy Falility. In the CF you
'               can open and display any VB file, mark text and add it incrementally to
'               an internal clipboard. Once done you can then paste the contents of the
'               clipboard into the current module at the caret position.
'
'           >>  Press any dead key (Cursor left/right/up/down, Page up/down, Pos1, End)
'               to get you out of the selected text and confirm the autocomplete.
'
'           >>  You can now type a questionmark after an API name which fails to trigger
'               autocompletion. If it still fails it isn't there (or faulty).
'
'           >>  Click middle button or mousewheel to return to caret position.
'
'           >>  Click on the horiz scrollbar thumb just once if the raster fails to adjust
'               to the horizontal position or doesn't show at all.
'
'           >>  In the Options Popup, when you turn on the Raster option a color dialog
'               will let you select the raster color.
'
'           >>  Click 'Refresh/Reset' if you have altered anything in the IDE that would
'               affect this AddIn (Font, FontSize, Indicatorbar or TabWidth) or if you
'               wish to go back to the last saved registry settings.

'Development History
'**********************************************************************************
'
'01Feb2007 Version 4.4.17   UMG
'
'Added Copy Facility and command bar button.
'The CF was generally overhauled. Formatter now uses almost the same CF.
'
'Added option to select ROP for drawing the grid. MaskPen did only work for white bckgnds.
'Tnx to Kibe for reporting this quirk.
'
'Streamlined some code, in particular with regard to the flashing arrow <===.
'Modified flashing arrow to honor font height.
'
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
'
'01Mar2006 Version 4.3.7    UMG
'
'Changed fCompare to make it insensitive to multiple spaces (except in literals).
'Fixed bug in cMD5 - Round 4 ACs(53) was numbered incorrectly.
'Fixed bug in fMultiline - had difficulties with quoted literals.
'Rewrote 25 lines limitation in fMultiline.
'Dis- and enabled Compare- and Reset-Menu-Buttons when required.
'Hide Caret while flashing caret region. Did not look too good with an overwrite caret.
'Added Idle Detection.
'
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
'
'22Nov2004 Version 4.2.8     UMG
'
'Fixed bug in compare window (fCompare) code coloring routine.
'Moved Other VB words into a loooong string.
'
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
'
'03Sep2004 Version 4.2.6    UMG
'
'Bugfix
'Added check in mSubclass.UnhookCodePane to see whether the current ActiveComponent
'is in fact 'something'.
'
'Added Autocomplete trigger Mode Unique: this mode autocompletes the words only
'when there is a unique match between the typed word fragment and the names
'available. An example will clarify the difference to the trigger length mode:
'
'   avalilable names McGyver
'                    McGovern
'                    Nobody
'
'   User types                  Response
'                   Length Mode(3)      Unique Mode
'
'   N                                   Nobody
'   No                                  Nobody
'   Nob             Nobody              Nobody
'
'   McG             McGyver
'   McGo            McGovern            McGovern
'
'That is - the Unique mode will respond when there is a single match only no matter how long,
'whereas the Trigger Length mode will respond on the first match (of possibly several)
'which has the reqired trigger length.
'
'This is in a way equivalent to a variable auto-adjusted trigger length.
'
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
'
'27Aug2004 Version 4.1.12    UMG
'
'Mousewheel now has a new name - you can call me Companion.
'
'Added fMultiline - this box allows you to enter multiline literals as you would
'like them to appear in a message box for example (WYSIWYG). The text is then expanded
'and formatted into a VB compliant syntax and inserted into your code at the caret position.
'Tnx to Evan Toder for letting me steal his idea; the code is completely different from
'his though: expansion/formatting is accomplished in one (admittedly long) line of code
'which only the compiler understands (and me ;-} of course).
'
'Added menu button Reset: clicking this button will undo ALL changes in the active module
'(code AND visual components) and reset it to the last saved state; the dirty flag is
'also reset. The dirty flag indicates that changes were made during the current session
'which have not yet been saved.
'
'Added menu button OpenAll: clicking this button will open all codepanes of each loaded
'project.
'
'Added Comparator. Click on menu button Compare to compare the current state of a module with
'it's last saved state.
'
'Fixed annoying bug in Function IsInCode regarding the 'As' keyword preceeding the currently
'typed word or word fragment; will no more interfere with VBs variable type popups
'unless you type 'AS' in capitals to permit autocompleting the variable type.
'
'Added resource string lookup in mMsgBoxEx.
'
'Added horizontal grid or raster lines. Selecting this option may make mouse-scrolling
'a little sluggish if your PC is one of the slower kind.
'
'Added resource string lookup to find the main window caption fragment which indicates
'that we are in design mode.
'
'Clarified some code passages and fixed a few minor qirks. Code cosmetics, in particular
'variable names and duplicated names or definitions / declarations...
'
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
'
'03Jul2004 Version 3.2.3    UMG
'
'Added mMsgBoxEx - extended message box based on Ray Mercer's code but heavily modified
'and debugged.
'Fixed quirk in fSetOpts validation of txtTriggerLength
'
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
'
'27Jan2004 Version 3.1.7    UMG
'
'Added check for correct api database.
'
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
'
'24Jan2004 Version 3.1.6    UMG
'
'GPF bug fix. Occured when there was no open code pane but an open form.
'Modified Icon show and hide.
'
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
'20Jan2004 Version 3.1.5    UMG
'
'Changed Options popup to secondary (right) mousebutton + scrollwheel.
'Added Fader.
'Changed Flashing Region again (is now a polygonic region).
'Fixed fSelect sizing/positioning and added border.
'Added scope count in fgdMembers.
'Added code window topline correction if code window size was changed.
'Added VB tab width recognition with ApiType body.
'No scan thru fgdMembers on exit keys.
'Added a few comments.
'
'New:
'----
'This AddIn can now optionally display a vertical raster or grid at the tab stop positions,
'however this function is by no means perfect but it will serve the purpose it is meant for,
'namely as a guide for indentation.
'
'To save time and resources re-drawing the raster is deferred until the end of a smooth mouse
'sroll, so it seems a bit 'sluggish'
'
'Known quirks:
'1  The VB tabwidth, font and indicatorbar may be altered while this AddIn is active, but this
'   will not be noticed until next startup or click on Refresh/Reset in fSetOpts.
'
'2  The Code Window Horizontal Scrollbar is a very stubborn thing indeed >:-(
'
'   Apparently the Scrollbar does not belong to the Code Window. So instead of using SB_HORZ
'   we have to wait for the first Scroll Msg and then we know an hWndScrollbar and can ask the
'   scrollbar for it's value via SB_CTL. The effect is that switching from one code pane to
'   another may result in the raster being off the correct position until the horiz scroll bar
'   is used again - click on thumb to redraw correct raster.
'
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
'15Jan2004 Version 2.6.3    UMG
'
'Added DeleteObject for Region (may have been a memory leak)
'Modified repositioning
'Made Flashing Region a Rounded tRECT
'Some code cosmetics
'
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
'18Dec2003 Version 2.5.7    UMG
'
'Made Return to Cursor (mouse middle button) and Selection Box (pause key)
'independent of AutoComplete option.
'
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
'28Dec2002 Version 2.4.3    UMG
'
'Added custom tooltip class.
'Added BitBlt Icon into VB's MDI window.
'
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
'21Dec2002 Version 2.3.6    UMG
'
'Replaced WM_SETFOCUS by WM_MOUSEACTIVATE = &H21
'Altered LastTop-Algorithm.
'Changed App.Title, so the entries in the Registry are no longer found, you will
'have to re-enter and save again. Also delete the previous Registry keys.
'
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
'11Dec2002 Version 2.3.3    UMG
'
'Changed Wheel Scrolling Algorithm so as to accumulate wheel events while scolling.
'Scroll speed increases with distance.
'Added High Resolution Timer functions.
'Added Scroll Speed Option - hover mouse over "Speed" label in Selection Box.
'Added RightButtonClick for exiting the Selection Box.
'Added Middle- or Wheel-Click to return to caret position. The circle drawn has
'    the correct size for FixedSys font, other fonts may need some adjustment
'    (find CreateEllipticRgn (near line 202 in mSubclass) to modify)
'
'Fixed Bug with RegSave Trigger Length.
'
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
'19Nov2002 Version 2.2.11   UMG
'
'Fixed or rather circumvented 'Paused-bug'; I don't know what's wrong there but
'AutoComplete is now suspended while we're in Paused mode and that apparently cures
'it. If anybody has a clue I'd be pleased to know...
'
'Changed selection list to flexgrid
'you can now sort the selection list by column and use the keyboard to position it.
'
'#################################################################################'
'==========
'IMPORTANT:
'==========
'This was developed using a German version of VB, so you have to translate one item:
'Search for [Entwerfen] and translate that to what your Main Window Caption says in
'square brackets when you're in Design Mode'(probably [design] in english) keeping
'the case (UPPER/lower).
'
'(this is no longer true after V3.3.12)
'
'See line 6 of mSubclass.
'##################################################################################
'
'Some code optimization.
'
'You can now type a questionmark after an API name which fails to trigger auto-
'completion (see ReadMe.txt)
'
'    for example
'    Private ApiDeclare SendMessage?
'
'    ...to distingish it from SendMessageCallback and SendMessageTimeout.
'
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
'13Oct2002 Version 2.2.8    UMG
'
'Added API database
'
'Use keywords:    ApiDeclare instead of  Declare Sub/Function
'                 ApiConst   instead of  Const
'                 ApiType    instead of  Type
'
' ...and then type a space and the name of the API member you wish to autocomplete.
'
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
'08Oct2002 Version 2.1.15   UMG
'
'Added fSelect - press Pause button to open member list
'    known quirk: the selection may be off a few bytes after the list is closed.
'                 (fixed - I hope)
'
'Added check for MDI / SDI.
'
'Some code optimization.
'
'Fixed quirk with space or newline input before a part keyword or a name.
'
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
'
'02Oct2002 Version 2.1.12   UMG
'
'Added IDE Codepane Auto Complete Function.
'
'Added fSetOpts options for Auto Complete.
'
'Modified subclassing.
'
'Fixed bug regarding scrolling an empty code pane.
'
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
'08Sep2002 Version 1.2.4    UMG

'Get scroll options from Registry, or from our own settings; compile time option
'no longer exists.

'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
'06Sep2002 Version 1.1.5    UMG
'
'"Exit" bug fixed - wasn't an Exit bug really: this happened when the user tried to
'scroll AND all codepanes were closed AND at least one codepane had been open before.
'       ===                           ===
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
'05Sep2002 Version 1.1.4    UMG
'
'Scrolling method changed - no sending keystrokes anymore.
'
'You can now slow down scrolling by factors 2, 3 or 4 by holding down the Shift key,
'the Cntl key or both respectively, while scrolling the mouse wheel.
'
'You also have the choice between two alternative scrolling modes at compile time
'by altering a single #Const.

'Now has a "fraction of page to scroll" - constant, currently set to 1/2, modify that
'as you like. If you feel like storing/getting this value from/in Settings: the only
'limit is your imagination.
