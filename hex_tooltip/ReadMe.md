Note: Stable on XP, WM_PAINT never being called on Win10 subclassed tooltip window? 
      maybe change tact to show another window next to tooltip of our own? use external
      exe version from dllhell for now on win10
      
      also this has been integrated into the fastbuild addin as a persistant checkbox option
      to load the dll. perfect for xp
      
Experimental

inject this into vb6 ide to have numeric tool tips values display hex along side decimal value.
